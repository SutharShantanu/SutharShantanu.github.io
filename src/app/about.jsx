    const words = `My journey to web development wasn't exactly linear. While prepping for government exams, I found myself captivated by the world my friends were building with lines of code. Witnessing their creations come alive on the screen sparked a curiosity within me. I craved that same magic â€“ the thrill of crafting something tangible from scratch. So, I took a leap of faith and enrolled in Masai School's grueling 30-week bootcamp. Let's just say those weeks were a whirlwind of challenges and triumphs. But with every hurdle cleared and every line of code mastered, my passion for web development only intensified.

Today, I'm not just a developer; I'm an artist who paints with code. I find immense satisfaction in building user-friendly interfaces and interactive web applications that not only function flawlessly but leave a lasting impression. But my ambitions extend beyond the digital realm. In the years to come, I aspire to leverage my technical expertise to create solutions that make a positive impact on society.

When I'm not glued to the screen, you might find me exploring new destinations, unwinding with a good video game, or simply cracking jokes and bringing laughter to those around me. My outgoing personality and creative spirit fuel my drive to excel in everything I do.`;
